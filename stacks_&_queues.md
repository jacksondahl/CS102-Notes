**FIFO** (first in first out)
- like a line for food

## Stack ADT
**LIFO** (Last-In, First-Out)
- ex - pez dispenser
- stack operations
	- push
	- pop
	- top
	- size
	
- ex - when using an array list, you want to use the back of the list as the "top"

## DEQue ADT
**D**ouble-**E**nded **Que**ues
- equally good at pushign and popping on either end
- ` # <deque>` (in c++ library)
